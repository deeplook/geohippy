## Introduction

**Geohippy** is a collection of libraries and clients for conducting interactive geospatial analysis and location intelligence in a Jupyter environment. While most originate from the rich Python-based geospatial ecosystem running in a Python 3 kernel a select few other kernels (Javascript, Typescript and C++) are provided as a basis for installing other components from outside this Python ecosystem as well. The idea is to have a go-to environment ready to use and test online with no installion needed, or to install and run all or parts of it locally. This is only a tiny sublist from the long list of available packages in no particular order: JupyterLab, NumPy, GeoPandas, GeoPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, Geemap, Leafmap, Cartopy, Ipyleaflet, Folium, HoloViews, Datashader, Streamlit, Deck.gl, Kepler.gl, Mapbox GL, HERE MapWidget, H3, Ipycanvas, Ipycytoscape, and Xyzservices. The environment file `environment.yml` lists many more (listing only direct dependencies). For now a few example notebooks illustrate only the simplest use-cases for getting started.
